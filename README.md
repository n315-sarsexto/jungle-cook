JungleCook is a great new innovative, beautiful collection of recipes. You can upload your own recipes and share them with others, and browse the various recipes available on the website. This is a full C.R.U.D application, allowing users to create data, read it, update it, and delete it. This project also is a collaborative effort between Summer Sexton and Kylee Dicken, in which split efforts are noted above.

Visitors to the JungleCook website can browse all available recipes, and make edits to them if they notice that they need to be made. The data for the recipes is driven by a .json file, which is then pulled in using jQuery and uploaded to the page using a Model-View-Controller, which follows the hashchange of the website.

Once a user is signed in or they create an account, they unlock additional features of the website. They can create their own recipe to submit to the JungleCook, and upon submit, their recipe gets added not only to the browse page, but to their recipe collection. They have the choice to edit it, view it, or even delete the recipe they made if they decide it needs to be deleted. Using javascript, the data of the recipe, and even a user's sign-in data, are then put into their respective json sections to keep the data up-to-date with the user's actions.

This project was styled using SASS, a CSS extension language. This made the styling cohesive across the entire website, making it not only function nicely, but look fantastic at the same time!
