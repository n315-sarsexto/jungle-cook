JungleCook is a great new innovative, beautiful collection of recipes. You can upload your own recipes and share them with others, and browse the various recipes available on the website. This is a full C.R.U.D application, allowing users to create data, read it, update it, and delete it. This project also is a collaborative effort between Summer Sexton and Kylee Dicken, in which split efforts are noted above.
